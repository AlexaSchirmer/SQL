# In this SQL Project I queried a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 What are the tables in this database?
SELECT name
FROM sqlite_schema
WHERE  type ='table'
AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%';

#2 How many orders were placed in January?
Select COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. How many of those orders (in January) were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product LIKE "Iphone"
GROUP BY (product)
HAVING length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON Customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#5 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

#6 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity) * price AS Total_Revenue 
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product <> 'Product' 
GROUP BY Product
HAVING Total_Revenue >0.0
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC
