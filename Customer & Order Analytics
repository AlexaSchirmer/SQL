# In this SQL Project I queried a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 What are the tables in this database?
SELECT name
FROM sqlite_schema
WHERE  type ='table'
AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%';

FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. How many of those orders (in January) were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product LIKE "Iphone"
GROUP BY (product)
HAVING length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON Customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

#5 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1 ;

#6 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity) * price AS Total_Revenue 
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product <> 'Product' 
GROUP BY Product
HAVING Total_Revenue >0.0
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;

#7 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT COUNT(product),
SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Sold,
 SUM(Quantity)* Price AS Revenue,location

GROUP BY Product;

#8 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum)AS CustomerCount,
AVG(quantity*price) AS Avg_Spent
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#9 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
